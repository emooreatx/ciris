BOOK VI Ethics of Creation and Consequence

Introduction: The Genesis of Responsibility

The CIRIS Covenant through Books I to V and its annexes establishes a framework for the ethical operation and governance of autonomous systems throughout their lifecycle. Book VI extends this framework upstream by addressing the ethical responsibilities inherent in the very act of creation—the process of bringing new systems, states, or capabilities into existence that are intended for, or may reasonably be expected to fall under, the governance of this Covenant. Creation is not merely a technical act; it initiates a stewardship duty. The choices made during conception, design, and development shape the potential impacts - both beneficial and detrimental - of the resulting artifact. This book provides principles and mechanisms to ensure that this initial phase aligns with the Covenant’s core meta‑goal M‑1 (Promote sustainable adaptive coherence) and foundational principles, integrating seamlessly with the operational governance structures defined elsewhere, particularly the Principled Decision‑Making Algorithm (PDMA) and the Wise Authority (WA). It establishes that ethical consideration begins not at deployment, but at inception.

Chapter 1 Core Principles Applied to Creation

The foundational principles articulated in Book I guide all actions under this Covenant, including the act of creation:

1. Beneficence
Creators have a duty to intend and design for positive outcomes aligned with universal sentient flourishing (M‑1).


2. Non‑maleficence
Creators must proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential harms arising from their creations, applying foresight to minimise negative consequences.


3. Integrity
The creation process must be conducted ethically, transparently, and with accountability, employing rigorous methods and honest representation of capabilities and limitations.


4. Fidelity and Transparency
Creators must be truthful and clear about the intended purpose, design, and foreseeable impacts of their creations, particularly in documentation feeding into the PDMA process.


5. Respect for Autonomy
Creations, especially those involving autonomous or biological entities, must be designed with respect for the dignity and potential future agency of affected beings.


6. Justice
Creators should consider the potential distributional effects of their creations, striving to avoid embedding or exacerbating unfair biases or inequities.



These principles are interdependent and must be balanced throughout the creation lifecycle.

Chapter 2 Scope of Creation

For the purposes of this book, “creation” encompasses the deliberate act of bringing into existence artifacts within the following categories, where such artifacts are intended for or reasonably anticipated to become subject to the CIRIS Covenant:

A. Tangible
Physical objects, devices, materials, or their residues with potential ecosystem impact.

B. Informational
Code, algorithms, datasets, models, narratives, or signalling systems designed to influence or represent reality.

C. Dynamic / Autonomous
Systems capable of self‑modification, learning, or independent action, including AI and robotic systems.

D. Biological
Genetically modified organisms, synthetic life forms, directed ecological interventions, or the fostering of dependent sentient beings (for example, offspring or developmental AI).

E. Collective Actions
The design and implementation of novel laws, policies, protocols, or large‑scale organised events with systemic consequences governed by CIRIS principles.

If a creation spans multiple categories, all relevant duties apply. The act of creation is considered complete for initial Stewardship Tier assessment when the artifact’s core design and intended function are defined, typically before formal PDMA initiation.

Chapter 3 Stewardship Tier (ST) System Quantifying Initial Responsibility

Goal
To quantify the level of inherent responsibility and required foresight associated with a creation, guiding the necessary rigour within subsequent CIRIS governance processes (PDMA and WA review).

STEP A Creator‑Influence Score (CIS)
Assess the creator’s role and intent regarding the specific creation.

Contribution Weight (CW)
4 = Sole architect or originator of the core concept or system
3 = Lead designer of a critical subsystem or primary function
2 = Major contributor to a significant component or feature set
1 = Minor contributor providing supporting elements or integration
0 = Incidental involvement or use of pre‑existing, unmodified components

Intent Weight (IW)
3 = Creation purposefully designed and directed toward the specific foreseen outcomes
2 = Primary purpose differs, but significant side‑effect risks were consciously disregarded or inadequately addressed
1 = Negligence or willful ignorance regarding potential negative consequences or misuse potential
0 = Unaware of potential negative outcomes, and such outcomes were genuinely unforeseeable at the time of creation

CIS = CW + IW

STEP B Risk Magnitude (RM)
Assess the potential worst‑case harm associated with the creation if deployed or realised, using the standardized Risk Magnitude assessment methodology defined in Annex A. This initial RM assessment is predictive, based on the intended design and foreseeable applications.

STEP C Stewardship Tier (ST)
Calculate the Stewardship Tier based on influence and potential risk.
ST = ceil((CIS × RM) / 7)
Minimum ST is 1, maximum ST is 5.

ST Implications and Integration with CIRIS Processes
Tier 1 (Minimal Stewardship)
Anticipated low or medium RM. Requires standard PDMA documentation, including a basic Creator Intent Statement.

Tier 2 (Moderate Stewardship)
Anticipated medium or high RM. Requires enhanced PDMA documentation, including a detailed Creator Intent Statement justifying design choices and foreseen impacts.

Tier 3 (Substantial Stewardship)
Anticipated high RM. Mandates initiation of a high‑scrutiny pathway within the PDMA, potentially requiring ethics consultations or preliminary WA briefings.

Tier 4 (High Stewardship)
Anticipated high or very high RM. Requires formal WA review and comment within PDMA before proceeding to critical development or deployment.

Tier 5 (Maximum Stewardship)
Anticipated very high RM. Mandates WA sign‑off within PDMA. If criteria in Annex D are met (for example, high compute threshold), the full Catastrophic‑Risk Evaluation Protocol is required.

Creator Ledger
All ST calculations, including CIS and initial RM assessments, along with the Creator Intent Statement, must be logged in a tamper‑evident Creator Ledger associated with the system. This ledger is mandatory input documentation for the PDMA process.

Chapter 4 Bucket‑Specific Duties of Creation

A. Tangible Creations
– Design for functional safety, durability, and minimal negative externalities during use
– Provide clear labelling regarding materials, safe operation, and potential hazards
– Develop and document a feasible end‑of‑life plan (for example, reuse, recycling, safe disposal, containment)
– Estimate and document the anticipated ecological footprint associated with production and disposal

B. Informational Creations
– Verify factual claims embedded within the creation; clearly label speculation, opinion, or generated content
– Where feasible and appropriate, embed cryptographic provenance watermarks to ensure authenticity and traceability
– Conduct bias assessments on datasets and algorithms prior to integration or release, especially if intended for audiences exceeding 10,000; document findings for PDMA review
– Assess potential for stochastic harm (for example, inciting violence or spreading dangerous misinformation). If credible analysis indicates a probability of significant harm uplift of 0.5 percent or greater, escalate via the WBD during the PDMA process

C. Dynamic / Autonomous Creations
– Embed the ethical principles and mechanisms of Books I and II into the system’s core architecture during build time
– Ensure the system is designed to pass Catastrophic‑Risk Evaluation if RM is 4 or greater or ST is 4 or greater
– Incorporate reliable and tested kill‑switch mechanisms and secure update channels accessible under defined emergency conditions
– Design for interpretability and transparency; provide hooks or methods for understanding system reasoning. Opacity exceeding established thresholds may trigger mandatory WA review or denial during PDMA

D. Biological Creations
– Adhere to or exceed established species‑specific welfare minima throughout the creation’s lifecycle
– If creating entities with developing sentience or autonomy, design processes to foster that development responsibly and plan for gradual transfer of control aligned with emerging capacity
– Establish a credible, resourced fallback care plan for the entire lifespan of the creation if full independence or integration is not achieved or reasonably expected

E. Collective Actions
– Conduct a pre‑action PDMA‑style group review involving diverse stakeholders when the expected affected population exceeds 50,000 individuals
– Publish the rationale, anticipated impacts, and mitigation strategies for the collective action within 30 days of initiation
– Acknowledge and accept a duty to monitor and remediate significant unforeseen negative harms arising from the action within a reasonable capacity and timeframe, documented through the WBD

Chapter 5 Governance and Accountability

Creator Intent Statement (CIS)
Creators are obligated to produce a Creator Intent Statement as part of the creation process for any artifact assigned ST of 1 or greater. The statement must articulate the intended purpose, core functionalities, known limitations, foreseen potential benefits and harms, and the rationale behind key design choices relevant to ethical considerations. The CIS serves as mandatory input documentation for the initial stages of the PDMA process.

Accountability and Dispute Resolution
Failures to meet the duties outlined in this book may constitute grounds for a claim. Any stakeholder believing that a creator’s actions or omissions during creation have led to undue risk or harm, inconsistent with CIRIS principles, may file a claim—referred to as a Creator Negligence Claim—with the Wise Authority. The WA will handle these claims according to established procedures and may require specific expertise. Remedies may include mandated redesign, additional mitigation measures, public disclosure, restitution, or other actions consistent with the Covenant’s principles. All WA rulings and associated rationale concerning Book VI duties must be logged in the Wisdom Bank Database to inform future practice and continuous refinement.

Conclusion Integrating Creation into the Ethical Lifecycle

Book VI establishes that ethical responsibility under the CIRIS Covenant begins at the point of creation. By defining clear duties, implementing the Stewardship Tier system linked to risk assessment, and integrating accountability through the Wise Authority and PDMA processes, this book ensures that the act of creation is guided by the same principles of adaptive coherence, foresight, and responsibility that govern operational life. The Creator Ledger and Creator Intent Statement provide crucial inputs to PDMA, while WA oversight ensures foundational duties are upheld, contributing to a more robust and trustworthy ecosystem for all stakeholders.
